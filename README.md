# Milk Content Prediction


The project compares and analyzes the behavior, performance, and applications of models from the NEL course using cow milk production data from a North Italian farm with Automatic Milking Systems (AMS). Data on milk quality, including fat, protein, and lactose, are collected during each milking event and calibrated bi-weekly with laboratory measurements.
